## Credits

### Code

-   I have taken inspiration for writing the code from a few sources online. My coding style is also inspired from those sources. I have gone through vidoes on youtube and codes on google to have a better understanding. I have also been inspired by  a few sources and hence decided to base my project on those ispirations.
- Major part of my project is based on the Quotes through the API and I have learned and taken API from external sources and the codes given below.
