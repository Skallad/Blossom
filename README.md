This website was created from the initial idea of having sketches accompanied by text describing different birth flowers. The idea derives from the recently found interest of mine in flowers and plants. The sketches intended to accompany the texts were dropped, but might be added in a later stage as I still want to implement more features and make the website more attractive towards users. Additional content in the future is a possibility as well, perhaps including birth stones.  



# User Experience - UX

  ## User stories
  ### As a first time visitor I want to:
   - easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the people behind it.
   - easily navigate through the website to find content.
   - be able to submit feedback if there is anything I want to tell the creator.

  ### As a returning visitor I want to:
   - extend my knowledge on birth flowers.
   - be able to submit feedback if needed.
   - access social media links.

  ### As a frequent user I want to:
   - see if there has been any changes made or content added to the website.
   - be able to contribute with ideas for additional content in the future.

## Design  

### Colour Scheme and palette
   -  The colours picked are *#f4f8fa #eaf2f3 #aec1ca #83a0b4* and *#576772*
   -  I chose to a blue monochromatic color scheme where I handpicked the colours based on what I thought suited well together.

### Typography
   - The main font throughout the website is Urbanist; used on header, footer and paragraphs as well as the form.
   -  Dongle was used for the tabs and headings for the content area of the page. Both fonts use sans-serif as a fallback font.

## Credits & Sources

### Code

-   I have taken inspiration and help for writing the code from a few sources, both from YouTube and W3schools to help me understand how the code works and how it can affect the outcome of the website.

### Sources
- [Tutorial for creating tabs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5pnVu_d3Mw)  
This tutorial greatly helped me implement the end results I wanted and be able to use the same functions but for the months where the flower descriptions are displayed.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)  
I took help from this website especially to learn more aobut using flexboxes and further extend my knowledge about MediaQueries as it helped me get the layout I wanted and for the website to respond on different screen sizes.
- [The Old Farmer's Almanac](https://www.almanac.com/) and [Truly Experiences](https://trulyexperiences.com/blog/birth-month-flowers/)  
These websites were used to collect information on the meanings behind birth flowers as well as history behind birth flowers.
