## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### As a first time visitor I want to:

        - easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the people behind it.
        - easily navigate through the website to find content.
        - be able to submit feedback if there is anything I want to tell the creator.

    -   #### As a returning visitor I want to:

        - extend my knowledge on birth flowers.
        - be able to submit feedback if needed.
        - access social media links.

        - be able to contribute with ideas for additional content in the future.

-   ### Design  

    -   #### Colour Scheme and palette
        - The colours picked are *#f4f8fa #eaf2f3 #aec1ca #83a0b4* and *#576772*  
            I chose to a blue monochromatic color scheme where I handpicked the colours based on what I thought suited well together.

## Credits

### Code

-   I have taken inspiration for writing the code from a few sources online. My coding style is also inspired from those sources. I have gone through vidoes on youtube and codes on google to have a better understanding. I have also been inspired by  a few sources and hence decided to base my project on those ispirations.
- Major part of my project is based on the Quotes through the API and I have learned and taken API from external sources and the codes given below.
