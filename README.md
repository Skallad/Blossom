## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about updated and new quotes.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to submit my own and new quotes adn generate new ones..
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find community links.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added functions regarding quotes, videos and more.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the website so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website.

    -  ### Design
      - I myself have created the background picture and wanted it to fit to the website perfectly without interrupting other colors.
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The colours used are <img src="https://coolors.co/f4f8fa-eaf2f3-aec1ca-83a0b4-576772">
        
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Amaranth font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Amaranth is a simple font which is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Videos
        -   The large, background video is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It is also relevant and explanatory.

## Credits

### Code

-   I have taken inspiration for writing the code from a few sources online. My coding style is also inspired from those sources. I have gone through vidoes on youtube and codes on google to have a better understanding. I have also been inspired by  a few sources and hence decided to base my project on those ispirations.
- Major part of my project is based on the Quotes through the API and I have learned and taken API from external sources and the codes given below.
