                            The symbolism for flowers have been around for thousands of years.
                            The birth flower on the other hand, though connected to flower symbolism and meaning,
                            represent the different months of the year.

                        <p>
                            Birth flowers are believed to have been around since Roman times, and tradition in different
                            cultures have carried the practice on through history to this day. Quite not as common as
                            birth
                            stones, they can still make for a nice accompaniment to birthday gifts!

                                                Carnations often symbolise love and rememberance if the colours are in
                                                varying shades of red or pink,
                                                whereas purple Carnations mean capriciousness and yellow symbolise
                                                disappointment and rejection.
                                                Striped Carnations signify regret. Carnations are often used during
                                                Mother's
                                                Day or Valentine's Day
                                                because of their meanings.

                                                Snowdrops can be used on both happy and sad occasions. For celebrations,
                                                they symbolise optimism and hope
                                                and during occasions such as death or misfortune, they have compassion
                                                as
                                                their main symbolism.
                                                The Snowdrop is strongly associated with innocence thanks to its white
                                                colour. Due to it often being
                                                the first flower to show up during early spring, it also can signify new
                                                beginnings and beauty!

                                                Holly? Their flowers symbolise
                                                life thanks to their evergreen leaves. If the Holly is in a wreath, they
                                                represent friendship and faithful love.
