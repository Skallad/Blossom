                                                disappointment and rejection.
                                                Striped carnations signify regret. carnations are often used during

                                                Snowdrops can be used on both happy and sad occasions. For celebrations,
                                                they symbolise optimism and hope
                                                and during occasions such as death or misfortune, they have compassion

                                                their main symbolism.
                                                The snowdrop is strongly associated with innocence thanks to its white
                                                colour. Due to it often being
                                                the first flower to show up during early spring, it also can signify new

                                                here to cheer you up! The narcissus has
                                                a cheerful yellow colour and symbolises new beginnings, rebirth and
                                                rejuvenation. Thanks to its ability to
                                                bloom year after year they also represent faithfulness.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Of course, 'tis the season! Who could go a Christmas without thinking of
                                                the holly? Their flowers symbolise life itself thanks to their evergreen
                                                leaves.
                                                If the Holly is in a wreath, they represent friendship and faithful
                                                love.
                                            </p>
