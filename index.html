                    <p>The symbolism for flowers have been around for thousands of years.
                        The birth flower on the other hand, though connected to flower symbolism and meaning,
                        represent the different months of the year.
                    </p>
                    <p>Birth flowers are believed to have been around since Roman times, and tradition in different
                        cultures have carried the practice on through history to this day. Quite not as common as birth
                        stones, they can still make for a nice accompaniment to birthday gifts!

                                        <p>Carnations oftens symbolise love and rememberance if the colours are in
                                            varying shades of red or pink,
                                            whereas purple Carnations mean capriciousness and yellow symbolise
                                            disappointment and rejection.
                                            Striped Carnations signify regret. Carnations are often used during Mother's
                                            Day or Valentine's Day
                                            because of their meanings.

                                            Snowdrops can be used on both happy and sad occasions. For celebrations,
                                            they symbolise optimism and hope
                                            and during occasions such as death or misfortune, they have compassion as
                                            their main symbolism.
                                            The Snowdrop is strongly associated with innocence thanks to its white
                                            colour. Due to it often being
                                            the first flower to show up during early spring, it also can signify new
                                            beginnings and beauty!

                                            Primrose symbolises young love, youth and everlasting existence! The word
                                            "primrose" originates from Latin's 'primus',
                                            which means 'first' or 'early'. Primroses are often one of the first flowers
                                            in spring to bloom.
