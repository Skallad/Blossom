                                                disappointment and rejection.
                                                Striped carnations signify regret. carnations are often used during

                                                Snowdrops can be used on both happy and sad occasions. For celebrations,
                                                they symbolise optimism and hope

                                                The snowdrop is strongly associated with innocence thanks to its white
                                                colour. Due to it often being
                                                the first flower to show up during early spring, it also can signify new

                                            <p>
                                                Of course, 'tis the season! Who could go a Christmas without thinking of
                                                the holly? Their flowers symbolise life itself thanks to their evergreen leaves. 
                                                If the Holly is in a wreath, they represent friendship and faithful love.
